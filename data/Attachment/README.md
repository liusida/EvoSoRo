# Experiment: Attachment

This is a demo experiment. In this experiment, a pre-trained robot is running and will hit two different voxels on the ground, one will stick on the robot and the other won't.

File Structure:

```bash
assets/robot.data # pre-trained robot
main.py # to produce VXD
rebuild.sh # to rebuild the newest code and copy executables to this directory
base.vxa # the base VXA for all VXD
Default.vxc # the default file for VoxCAD, no need to touch this
```

Other files maybe produced in the experiment:

```bash
workspace/ # to store temperary data (for distributing tasks.)
gen01.vxd # the VXD generated by main.py
a.history # we usually pipe the output of the screen(stdout) to this file, so we can use VoxCAD to visualize it
output.xml # the experiment output for one generation
VoxCAD # the executable for VoxCAD
Voxelyze3 # the executable for Voxelyze3
vx3_node_worker # the internal executable used by Voxelyze3
```
